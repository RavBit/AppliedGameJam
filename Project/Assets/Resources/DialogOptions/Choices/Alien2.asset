  Dilemma: Greetings your highness, I come to you with a most lucrative proposal.
    I have engineered a crop species that produces toxins, protecting it from any
    unwanted pests and ensuring our people remain well fed. With your approval I could
    bring it to the market, revolutionizing our pesticide management and preventing
    crop loss. I can assure you this would generate quite a profit, our most reverent
    ruler.
