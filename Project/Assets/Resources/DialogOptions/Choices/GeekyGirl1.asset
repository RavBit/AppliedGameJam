  Dilemma: Our company, Solargized, would like to develop a solar farm in the desert
    south of Sancsis Town. A photovoltaic power station will provide more than enough
    energy for the little town and might turn up a profit eventually, as we may sell
    energy to neighbouring towns. If your majesty is willing to meet our investment,
    we can share profits.
