  Dilemma: Our company, Solargized, would like to develop a solar farm in the desert
    south of Oasith. A photovoltaic power station will provide more than enough energy
    for the little town and might turn up a profit eventually, as we may sell energy
    to neighbouring towns. If your majesty is willing to meet our investment, we can
    share profits.
