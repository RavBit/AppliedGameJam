  Dilemma: I come to you with a most lucrative proposal. I have engineered a crop
    species that produces toxins, protecting it from any unwanted pests and ensuring
    our people remain well fed. With your approval I could bring it to the market,
    revolutionizing our pesticide management and preventing cropp loss. I can assure
    you this would generate quite a profit, our most reverent ruler.
