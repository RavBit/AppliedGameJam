  Dilemma: Hello your highness, we, your city planners, have come together and made
    a proposal for the city center of our great city Citopolis. We suggest moving
    some of the industry to the hinterlands. This will greatly improve the living
    conditions and appeal of the city center. On top of that it allows us to expand
    the industry further as there is plenty of space in the hinterlands. The wetlands
    outside of the city are of little use as they are now, but this new industrial
    area will put our great city on the map, your highness!
