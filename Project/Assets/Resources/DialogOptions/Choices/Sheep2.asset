  Dilemma: I own Beelicious, a bee farm capable of producing the sweetest honey. Recently
    many of my bees have been incapable of finding their colonies, appearing completely
    disoriented. Some colonies have even started dying! I am sure it is the insecticides
    those farmers in the area use. Would you perhaps considering banning the particular
    pesticides they use, it kills more than just their problems!
